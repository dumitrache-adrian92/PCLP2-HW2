Basically my first time tackling any assembly language seriously as lab exercises were mostly examples and very little writing code from scratch, the point of the assignment was to write just functions with the entry parameters already given (since it was supposed to be done without knowledge of functions or the stack, though use of them was allowed).

These functions include a step cipher, beaufort encryption and spiral encryption of messages, as well as a couple easier exercises related to geometry and determining if some numbers were perfect square. I definitely got more comfortable reading and writing assembly while doing this, I went in not even knowing the purpose of all registers, but everything was challenging enough to learn a bunch of techniques out of need. I also learned how to use the stack to preserve registers because global variables are awful.

As a side note, my beaufort encryption was so slow (like 5 seconds instead of instant) that it didn't go through the automatic checking process used by this course's team since they set the check time extremely low, my lab assistant changed it himself to 20 minutes which caused chaos on the deadline day as someone uploaded an infinite loop which was checked for 20 minutes each time the madman uploaded it. Fun.
